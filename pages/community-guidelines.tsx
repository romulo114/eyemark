				The Eyemark Community is an online forum where the citizens of
				Nigeria at home or in the diaspora can follow, view, discuss,
				and give feedback on the projects embarked on by the Federal
				Government of Nigeria. The goal is to enlighten members of the
				public, educate, and pass feedback to decision-makers in
				government. Non-citizens who love Nigeria are also welcome!
